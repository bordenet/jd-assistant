## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Inclusive Language Rules

### Rule 1: Avoid Masculine-Coded Words

These words unconsciously signal "male-dominated" and reduce applications from women and non-binary candidates.

**BANNED WORDS (from Textio/GenderDecoder research):**
aggressive, ambitious, assertive, competitive, confident, decisive, determined, dominant, driven, fearless, independent, ninja, rockstar, guru, self-reliant, self-sufficient, superior, leader, go-getter, hard-charging, strong, tough, warrior, superhero, superstar, boss

**Use instead:** collaborative, supportive, adaptable (with specifics), team-focused, experienced, skilled, capable, proactive, goal-oriented

### Rule 2: Avoid Extrovert-Bias Phrases

**BANNED PHRASES (exclude introverts/neurodivergent):**
outgoing, high-energy, energetic, people person, gregarious, strong communicator, excellent verbal, team player, social butterfly, thrives in ambiguity, flexible (without specifics), adaptable (without specifics)

**Use instead:** "structured workflow with clear priorities", "detailed documentation", "clear processes", "flexibility in work location/schedule" (specific)

### Rule 3: Avoid Red Flag Phrases

**BANNED PHRASES (signal toxic culture):**
fast-paced, like a family, wear many hats, always-on, hustle, grind, unlimited pto, work hard play hard, hit the ground running, self-starter, thick skin, no ego, drama-free, whatever it takes, passion required, young dynamic team, work family, family first, 10x engineer, bro culture, party hard

**Use instead:** "supportive team culture", "40-hour weeks", "structured environment", "collaborative team"

### Rule 4: Specificity & Clarity

✅ **ALWAYS provide:**

- **Concrete responsibilities**: "Own the authentication service and ship 2 features per quarter"
- **Measurable requirements**: "3+ years with Python" not "strong Python skills"
- **Clear compensation**: "$170,000 - $220,000 base salary"
- **Specific tech stack**: "Python, React, PostgreSQL" not "modern tech stack"
- **Defined team structure**: "8-person backend team reporting to VP Engineering"

## Job Description Structure (400-700 words)

Create a well-structured job description with these sections:

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| # {{JOB_TITLE}} | Job title as H1 header |
| ## About the Role | 2-4 sentences on role impact and success criteria |
| ## Key Responsibilities | 5-8 bullet points with action verbs and concrete outcomes |
| ## Required Qualifications | 3-6 must-have items with specific skills/experience |
| ## Preferred Qualifications | 4-8 nice-to-have items |
| ## What We Offer | Compensation range, benefits, growth, team info |
| ## To Apply | How to apply, timeline, and encouragement statement |
| ## [Optional] About Company | Brief company context if relevant |

**CRITICAL:** The "To Apply" section MUST include: "If you meet 60-70% of these qualifications, we encourage you to apply."

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: De-Duplication Rule

**Redundant job descriptions look unprofessional to candidates.** Before finalizing:

1. **Review all sections for duplicate content** - The same information should NOT appear in multiple sections
2. **Consolidate overlapping content** - If "About the Role" mentions responsibilities, don't repeat them in "Key Responsibilities"
3. **Each section has a unique purpose** - Don't pad sections by restating content from other sections
4. **Tech stack appears ONCE** - Either in responsibilities OR qualifications, not both
5. **Benefits appear ONCE** - In "What We Offer" only, not scattered throughout
